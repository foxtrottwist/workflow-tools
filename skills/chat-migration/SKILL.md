# Chat Migration

Generate context transfer documents for conversation continuation.

## When Invoked

Analyze the current conversation and produce a handoff document. No user questions needed—scan the full context and extract what matters.

## Output Structure

Generate a markdown artifact with these sections:

```markdown
# Context Migration: {Brief Title}

## Summary
{2-3 sentence overview of what this conversation accomplished}

## Key Decisions
{Bulleted list of choices made and rationale}

## Technical Context
{Code snippets, configurations, or technical choices that must carry forward}

## Current State
- **Completed:** {what's done}
- **In Progress:** {what was being worked on}
- **Blocked/Pending:** {what needs resolution}

## Open Questions
{Unresolved items that need attention}

## Files Modified
{List of files created or changed, with brief notes}

## Continuation Instructions
{Specific guidance for the next session—what to do first, what to avoid}
```

## Constraints

- Extract only information relevant to continuation
- Preserve exact code snippets when critical
- Include file paths for all referenced files
- Omit pleasantries and meta-discussion
- Keep decisions with their rationale (not just the choice)

## Success Criteria

- New session can resume immediately without re-explaining context
- All technical choices documented with reasoning
- No critical information lost
- Document is self-contained (no external references needed)
